#+title: Experimental Hexdumps
#+author: Lee Thompson

** Summary

Here is a little repo containing some of my experiments with creating better/more interesting hexdump tools. Some may take alternate display strategies or use more exotic terminal emulator features.


** Running

See the [[https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan][cosmopolitan libc repo]], which is included as a submodule in this project, for more details on building/running on your system. I use [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][GCC]] on Gentoo Linux.


** Inspiration/References

A lot of early inspiration came from the work of [[https://justine.lol/index.html][Justine Tunney]]'s examples of using extended or altered character sets to describe more about the hex data being viewed.
